# Quick Installation

Pyrsia can easily be setup on a local Ubuntu (or Debian based) machine by using our `apt` installer package.

## Supported Platforms

:::warning Limited platform support

Currently our team is working very hard on core features and installers for other operating systems.

:::

- Ubuntu Focal (x86_64)
- Windows (x86_64)

Until we provide installers for other operating systems, you can start using Pyrsia
by running our [pre-built Docker image](#run-pyrsia-in-docker) or [build Pyrsia from source](/docs/community/get_involved/local_dev_setup.md).

## Windows

:::warning Minimal installer functionality

In version 0.2 we chose to include a mininal Windows installer. It simply installs the node and cli executables that need
to be run manually. Also the installer is not yet signed, so you need to ignore some warnings. We plan to fix this is subsequent releases.

:::

- Download the latest Windows installer from our [release page](https://github.com/pyrsia/pyrsia/releases/).

- Run the installer
    - Either simply double-click or use the `msiexec` command described below
    - You need to ignore a warning because we didn't sign our installer yet

Instead of double-clicking the installer, you can also run it like this, open a command prompt (type: Win+R + cmd):
```shell
msiexec /i Downloads/pyrsia-installer-0.2.0.msi ROOTDRIVE="C:"
```

- The installer will now install Pyrsia (pyrsia_node.exe and pyrsia.exe) in `C:\Pyrsia` unless you specified a different
  ROOTDRIVE in the previous step.

- Open a command prompt (type Win+R + cmd) and type

```shell
SET RUST_LOG=info
cd c:\Pyrsia\Pyrsia\service
pyrsia_node.exe
```

This will start your local Pyrsia node with `info` logs. (you can also skip `SET RUST_LOG=info` if you don't want logs,
or set this to `SET RUST_LOG=debug` to see even more logs)

When you first start the Pyrsia node, Windows might ask you to allow Pyrsia to make network connections, so make sure to
allow this.

- Once your Pyrsia node is running, open another command prompt and verify it's running:

```shell
pyrsia --version
```

```text
pyrsia_cli 0.2.0
```

```shell
pyrsia ping
```

```text
Connection Successful !!
```

If the pyrsia command cannot be found, make sure `C:\Pyrsia\Pyrsia\bin` is in your `%PATH%` or simply `cd` to that path
and run pyrsia from there.

To verify you received the transparency logs from the network, run this:

```shell
pyrsia inspect-log docker --image alpine:3.16.0
```

This should output something like this:

```text
Inspect log request returns the following logs: ...
```

Including the JSON output of the retrieved transparency logs for `alpine:3.16.0`.

Now you are ready to follow the instructions in [Configure Docker to use Pyrsia](docker.md) to make actual use of Pyrsia.

## Linux

### Using the Web Script

```sh
curl -sS https://pyrsia.io/install.sh | sh
```

### From the Command Line

```sh
# Update system and install base tooling
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y wget gnupg

# Add the Pyrsia keys to verify packages
wget -q -O - https://repo.pyrsia.io/repos/Release.key |  gpg --dearmor  > pyrsia.gpg
sudo install -o root -g root -m 644 pyrsia.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
rm pyrsia.gpg
echo "deb https://repo.pyrsia.io/repos/nightly focal main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update

# Install
sudo apt-get install -y pyrsia
```

### Verify everything is running smoothly

```sh
$ pyrsia --version
pyrsia 0.2.0
$ pyrsia ping
Connection Successful !!
```

If you see the following output, then your installation has failed.

```sh
$ pyrsia ping
Error: error sending request for url (http://localhost:7888/v2): error trying to connect: tcp connect error: Connection refused (os error 111)
```

To verify you received the transparency logs from the network, run this:

```shell
pyrsia inspect-log docker --image alpine:3.16.0
```

This should output something like this:

```text
Inspect log request returns the following logs: ...
```

Including the JSON output of the retrieved transparency logs for `alpine:3.16.0`

Now you are ready to follow the instructions in [Configure Docker to use Pyrsia](docker.md) to make actual use of Pyrsia.

## Run Pyrsia in Docker

As a temporary alternative to the installation scripts for the supported platforms,
you can also choose to run our pre-built Docker image available in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/pyrsiaoss/pyrsia-node)

Make sure you have Docker installed on your system and run:

```sh
docker run -p 7888:7888 pyrsiaoss/pyrsia-node:0.1.0-2338
```

Or use this `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  pyrsia:
    image: pyrsiaoss/pyrsia-node:0.1.0-2338
    ports:
      - "7888:7888"
    volumes:
      - "pyrsia:/pyrsia"

volumes:
  pyrsia:
```

And start running Pyrsia in the background:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Tail the logs to check if Pyrsia started correctly:

```sh
docker-compose logs -f
```

Or use the pyrsia CLI like this:

```sh
docker exec pyrsia-1 pyrsia ping
Connection Successful !!
```

(replace pyrsia-1 with the name of your Pyrsia container)
