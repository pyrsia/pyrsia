# Quick Installation

Pyrsia can easily be setup on a local Ubuntu (or Debian based) machine by using our `apt` installer package.

## Supported Platforms

:::warning Limited platform support

Currently our team is working very hard on core features and installers for other operating systems.

:::

- Ubuntu Focal (x86_64)

Until we provide installers for other operating systems, you can start using Pyrsia
by running our [pre-built Docker image](#run-pyrsia-in-docker) or [build Pyrsia from source](/docs/community/get_involved/local_dev_setup.md).

## Using the Web Script

```sh
curl -sS https://pyrsia.io/install.sh | sh
```

## From the Command Line

```sh
# Update system and install base tooling
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y wget gnupg

# Add the Pyrsia keys to verify packages
wget -q -O - https://repo.pyrsia.io/repos/Release.key |  gpg --dearmor  > pyrsia.gpg
sudo install -o root -g root -m 644 pyrsia.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
rm pyrsia.gpg
echo "deb https://repo.pyrsia.io/repos/nightly focal main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update

# Install
sudo apt-get install -y pyrsia
```

## Verify everything is running smoothly

```sh
$ pyrsia --version
pyrsia 0.1.0
$ pyrsia ping
Connection Successful !! {}
```

If you see the following output, then your installation has failed.

```sh
$ pyrsia ping
Error: error sending request for url (http://localhost:7888/v2): error trying to connect: tcp connect error: Connection refused (os error 111)
```

## Run Pyrsia in Docker

As a temporary alternative to the installation scripts for the supported platforms,
you can also choose to run our pre-built Docker image available in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/pyrsiaoss/pyrsia-node)

Make sure you have Docker installed on your system and run:

```sh
docker run -p 7888:7888 pyrsiaoss/pyrsia-node
```

Or use this `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  pyrsia:
    image: pyrsiaoss/pyrsia-node
    ports:
      - "7888:7888"
    volumes:
      - "pyrsia:/pyrsia"

volumes:
  pyrsia:
```

And start running Pyrsia in the background:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Tail the logs to check if Pyrsia started correctly:

```sh
docker-compose logs -f
```

Or use the pyrsia CLI like this:

```sh
docker exec pyrsia-1 pyrsia ping
Connection Successful !!
```

(replace pyrsia-1 with the name of your Pyrsia container)
