# Quick Installation

Pyrsia can easily be setup on a local Ubuntu (or Debian based) machine by using our `apt` installer package.

## Supported Platforms

We support the following platforms to run Pyrsia.

- [Windows (x86_64)](#windows)
- [macOS (x86_64)](#macos)
- [Ubuntu Focal (x86_64)](#linux)
- [pre-built Docker image](#run-pyrsia-in-docker)
- [build Pyrsia from source](/docs/community/get_involved/local_dev_setup.md)

Please let us know if the platform of your choice is not yet supported.

## Windows

:::note Minimal installer functionality

In version 0.2 we chose to include a minimal Windows installer. It simply installs the node and cli executables that need
to be run manually. Also the installer is not yet signed, so you need to ignore some warnings. We plan to fix this in subsequent releases.

:::

- Download the latest Windows installer from our [release page](https://github.com/pyrsia/pyrsia/releases/).

- Run the installer
    - Either simply double-click or use the `msiexec` command described below
    - If you get a "Windows protected your PC" warning, click more info, and click run anyway because we haven't signed our installer yet.

Instead of double-clicking the installer, you can also run it like this, open a command prompt (type: Win+R + cmd):
```shell
msiexec /i Downloads/pyrsia-installer-0.2.2.msi ROOTDRIVE="C:"
```

- The installer will now install Pyrsia (pyrsia_node.exe and pyrsia.exe) in `C:\Pyrsia` unless you specified a different
  ROOTDRIVE in the previous step.

- Open a command prompt (type Win+R + cmd) and type

```shell
SET RUST_LOG=info
cd c:\Pyrsia\Pyrsia\service
.\pyrsia_node.exe
```

This will start your local Pyrsia node with `info` logs. (you can also skip `SET RUST_LOG=info` if you don't want logs,
or set this to `SET RUST_LOG=debug` to see even more logs)

When you first start the Pyrsia node, Windows might ask you to allow Pyrsia to make network connections, so make sure to
allow this.

- Once your Pyrsia node is running, open another command prompt and verify it's running:

```shell
pyrsia --version
```

```text
pyrsia_cli 0.2.2
```

```shell
pyrsia ping
```

```text
Connection Successful !!
```

If the pyrsia command cannot be found, make sure `C:\Pyrsia\Pyrsia\bin` is in your `%PATH%` or simply `cd` to that path
and run pyrsia from there.

To verify you received the transparency logs from the network, run this:

```shell
pyrsia inspect-log docker --image alpine:3.16.0
```

This should output something like this:

```text
[
  {
    "artifact_hash": "2408cc74d12b6cd092bb8b516ba7d5e290f485d3eb9672efc00f0583730179e8",
    "artifact_id": "f3f2c69c-3387-47d0-96c8-cb57b3e9f1ae",
    "id": "70d17e31-14b5-4e00-9107-acc95e8bf5c8",
    "node_id": "bde95c7a-1397-470a-8f07-d9f13e97dffe",
    "node_public_key": "a65f7c06-cdc9-4210-b0c1-1a08311231ec",
    "num_artifacts": 4,
    "operation": "AddArtifact",
    "package_specific_artifact_id": "alpine@sha256:2408cc74d12b6cd092bb8b516ba7d5e290f485d3eb9672efc00f0583730179e8",
    "package_specific_id": "alpine:3.16.0",
    "package_type": "Docker",
    "source_id": "ddd37612-5da8-4b74-b884-5fa1e2fb1a52",
    "timestamp": 1666096808
  },
  ...
]
```

Including the JSON output of the retrieved transparency logs for `alpine:3.16.0`.

Now you are ready to follow the instructions in [Configure Docker to use Pyrsia](docker.md) to make actual use of Pyrsia.

## macOS

:::note Minimal installer functionality

In version 0.2 we choose to include minimalistic macOS installer. The installer is available through Homebrew package manager.

:::

### Using Homebrew Package Manager

- Homebrew is a free macOS package manager that allows you to install, update, or remove software by running commands in
the terminal. Homebrew makes it easy to install the latest versions of various software for macOS. Find the
Homebrew installation [link](https://brew.sh/) here.

- Use [Pyrsia Taps](https://github.com/pyrsia/homebrew-pyrsia) (Third-Party Repositories)

```shell
brew tap pyrsia/pyrsia
```
- Use brew installer to install Pyrsia
```shell
brew install pyrsia
```
- Open a terminal and start Pyrsia Node as background service using the following
```shell
brew services start pyrsia
```
As per service configuration, Pyrsia Node service logging level set to `info` except module pyrsia set to `debug`.

When you start the Pyrsia node for the first time, a directory is created in `$(brew --prefix)/var/pyrsia/` where all logs and blockchain data are saved. Also macOS might ask for network connection permission. So make sure to allow this.

- Once Pyrsia node is running state, similar kind of logs can be found in the Homebrew log file.
```
 $ tail -f $(brew --prefix)/var/pyrsia/logs/stdout/pyrsia_node.log
 2022-10-20T07:45:57.707Z INFO  pyrsia_node > Pyrsia Node will start running on 0.0.0.0:7888

```
- Open another terminal to verify everything is running smoothly.
    - To verify Pyrsia version
```shell
pyrsia --version
```
Display the version `pyrsia_cli 0.2.2`
    - To verify your local Pyrsia node connected to Pyrsia network
```shell
pyrsia ping
```
If your node successfully connected to the Pyrsia network you will see `Connection Successful !!`
    - To verify you received the transparency logs from the network, run this:
```shell
pyrsia inspect-log docker --image alpine:3.16.0
```
This should output something like this:
```text
Inspect log request returns the following logs: ...
```

Including the JSON output of the retrieved transparency logs for `alpine:3.16.0`.

Now you are ready to follow the instructions in [Configure Docker to use Pyrsia](docker.md) to make actual use of Pyrsia.

## Linux

### Using the Web Script

```sh
curl -sS https://pyrsia.io/install.sh | sh
```

### From the Command Line

```sh
# Update system and install base tooling
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y wget gnupg

# Add the Pyrsia keys to verify packages
wget -q -O - https://repo.pyrsia.io/repos/Release.key |  gpg --dearmor  > pyrsia.gpg
sudo install -o root -g root -m 644 pyrsia.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
rm pyrsia.gpg
echo "deb https://repo.pyrsia.io/repos/nightly focal main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update

# Install
sudo apt-get install -y pyrsia
```

### Installer Bootstrapping other than default cluster

To connect Pyrsia peer-node authorized boot-node other than default authorize boot node, here is the hack. You have to
make some edits to `pyrsia.service` file.

```shell
# E.G. bootstrapping to nightly-cluster.
sudo sed -i '/ExecStart=/ s/$/ --bootstrap-url http:\/\/boot.nightly.pyrsia.link\/status/' $(sudo find /etc -name pyrsia.service)

# reload daemon & restart service
systemctl daemon-reload
service pyrsia restart
```

### Verify everything is running smoothly

```sh
$ pyrsia --version
pyrsia 0.2.2
$ pyrsia ping
Connection Successful !!
```

If you see the following output, then your installation has failed.

```sh
$ pyrsia ping
Error: error sending request for url (http://localhost:7888/v2): error trying to connect: tcp connect error: Connection refused (os error 111)
```

To verify you received the transparency logs from the network, run this:

```shell
pyrsia inspect-log docker --image alpine:3.16.0
```

This should output something like this:

```text
[
  {
    "artifact_hash": "2408cc74d12b6cd092bb8b516ba7d5e290f485d3eb9672efc00f0583730179e8",

  ...
]
```

Including the JSON output of the retrieved transparency logs for `alpine:3.16.0`

Now you are ready to follow the instructions in [Configure Docker to use Pyrsia](docker.md) to make actual use of Pyrsia.

## Run Pyrsia in Docker

As a temporary alternative to the installation scripts for the supported platforms,
you can also choose to run our pre-built Docker image available in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/pyrsiaoss/pyrsia-node).

### Docker

Make sure you have Docker installed on your system and run in the background:

(Add an option `-e RUST_LOG=debug` to change the log level from the default value, `info`.)

```sh
docker run -d -p 7888:7888 --name pyrsia_node pyrsiaoss/pyrsia-node:0.2.2-2699
```

Tail the logs to check if Pyrsia started correctly:

```sh
docker logs -f pyrsia_node
```

Or use the pyrsia CLI like this:

```sh
docker exec pyrsia_node pyrsia ping
Connection Successful !!
```

### Docker Compose

Use this `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  pyrsia:
    image: pyrsiaoss/pyrsia-node:0.2.2-2699
    ports:
      - "7888:7888"
    volumes:
      - "pyrsia:/pyrsia"

volumes:
  pyrsia:
```

Add the following setting to change the log level (`info` is set as a default value):

```yaml
services:
  pyrsia:
    environment: # This is optional.
      - RUST_LOG=debug
```

Start running Pyrsia in the background:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Tail the logs to check if Pyrsia started correctly:

```sh
docker-compose logs -f
```

Or use the pyrsia CLI like this:

```sh
docker exec pyrsia-1 pyrsia ping
Connection Successful !!
```

(replace pyrsia-1 with the name of your Pyrsia container)
