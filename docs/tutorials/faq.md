#  FAQ

### Can I run a Pyrsia node?

Yes, have a look at [Quick Installation](/docs/tutorials/quick-installation.mdx)
and one of the package specific tutorials on [Docker](docker) or [Maven](maven).

### Do I have to participate in artifact distribution?

The more nodes participate in artifact distribution, the better of course. But if
you only want to run a Pyrsia node to consume artifacts, that works as well.
