# Learn the Community Expectations and Roles

Pyrsia is a community project. Consequently, it is wholly dependent on its community to provide a productive, friendly and collaborative environment. Our contributors fit into 3 basic categories: Community, Member, and Maintainer.

## Community Contributors

Community Contributors are the heartbeat of the Pyrsia Community. Their main tasks include: adopting Pyrsia, finding bugs, opening tickets, sharing helpful comments with others, sharing blogs, and providing feedback. Your involvement at this level drives the Pyrsia road map.

## Member Contributors

Those interested in a deeper level of involvement should become Member Contributors, which we consider Pyrsiaâ€™s most influential. Member Contributors assign themselves support tickets and review pull requests. In addition, they share use cases, provide feedback for potential feature enhancements, and engage in social networking about Pyrsia. Member Contributors attend the General Community Meetings to stay up to date with the progress of Pyrsia.

## Maintainer Contributors

Maintainer Contributors attend meetings on a frequent regular basis, stepping up to work on key development tasks. Those are the activities that can qualify you as a Maintainer Contributor. Maintainer Contributors complete a large part of the work that needs to be done to keep the Pyrsia project relevant to the broader community. Maintainer Contributors are individuals who have developed a higher level of expertise and are thus qualified to provide final approval of pull requests. In addition, they develop product enhancements, create documentation, and make online videos and tutorial content.

## Chairs

Chairs provide additional project management support, distribute issues to beginners, and manage meetings and recordings. Chairs must attend most meetings and help new contributors be successful.

We encourage you to participate at the level of your choice.
