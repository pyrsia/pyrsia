### What is Ed25519

Ed25519 is a public-key signature scheme built out of edwards25519 curve, using the EdDSA construction. An Ed25519 public key is the encoding of the 𝑥 and 𝑦 coordinates of a point on edwards25519

### What is X25519

X25519 is an elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange using Curve25519. It allows two parties to jointly agree on a shared secret using an insecure channel. An X25519 public key is the encoding of the 𝑥 coordinate of a point on Curve25519, hence the name X25519

### What is Curve25519

Curve25519 is an elliptic curve over the finite field 𝔽~𝑝~, where 𝑝=2<sup>255</sup>−19, whence came the 25519 part of the name. Specifically, it is the Montgomery curve 𝑦<sup>2</sup>=𝑥<sup>3</sup>+486662𝑥<sup>2</sup>+𝑥

### What is Edwards25519

Edwards25519 is an elliptic curve over the finite field 𝔽~𝑝~, where 𝑝=2<sup>255</sup>−19, with a different shape, the twisted Edwards shape −𝑥<sup>2</sup>+𝑦<sup>2</sup>=1−(121665/121666)𝑥<sup>2</sup>𝑦<sup>2</sup>, which admits fast computation of 𝑃+𝑄 given the 𝑥 and 𝑦 coordinates of 𝑃 and 𝑄. It is related to Curve25519 by a birational map, so most points on Curve25519 can be mapped to edwards25519 and vice versa
