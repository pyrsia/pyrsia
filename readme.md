## Current Development Phase

_ðŸ“¢ We are looking for your feedback!_

This project is currently in "early alpha". We are actively building on our minimal viable product which will continue
to evolve over time as we add new features and support more workflows.

Have a use case or workflow you would like to see supported? Open an issue or share on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cdeliveryfdn/shared_invite/zt-1eryue9cw-9YpgrfIfsTcDS~hGHchURg).
Check out our [Get Involved](https://pyrsia.io/docs/get_involved/) page for more ways to connect.

### Primary Focus

To get off the ground the focus is strictly on the peer-to-peer distribution of Docker images backed by a blockchain of identifiers.

## Looking to Contribute

Take a moment to review our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/pyrsia/.github/blob/main/contributing.md).
You can join our community on [Slack](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C02RC7Y5EUV) or participate in a [meeting](https://pyrsia.io/docs/social/#calendar) to pick up an issue. We also have our [Local Setup Guide](https://pyrsia.io/docs/get_involved/local_dev_setup/) to help.

## Install Pyrsia and Join the Network

There's a web script that will set everything up.

```sh
curl -sS https://pyrsia.io/install.sh | sh
```

For more options and information, checkout our [online tutorial](https://pyrsia.io/docs/tutorials/quick-installation/)

### Downloading Your First Artifact

Let's exercise the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) integration.

```sh
docker pull ubuntu
```

### Node and CLI

There are two components of this project

- **[CLI](pyrsia_cli/)**: A basic interface which communicates with a node.
- **[Node](pyrsia_node/)**: An instance of the Pyrsia daemon which can participate in the network with other nodes.

### Connecting with other Nodes

The Pyrsia node will always join the "main net" and connect with other peers. You can see this using the CLI's "status" command:

```sh
$ ./pyrsia status
Connected Peers Count:   17 # Shows the number of visible peers
Artifacts Count:         3 {"manifests": 1, "blobs": 2} # Total number of artifacts cached locally
Total Disk Space Allocated:  5.84 GB
Disk Space Used:             0.0002%
```

### Cloud Deployment

Pyrsia nodes can be deployed on the cloud using [pyrsia_node helmcharts](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/pyrsia-nightly/pyrsia-node). These nodes will act as the Authority nodes and participate as boot nodes on the network.
