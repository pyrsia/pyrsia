> Zero-Trust Decentralized Package Network

## Current Development Phase

_üì¢ We are looking for your feedback!_

This project is currently in the "sandbox" üèñÔ∏è. We are actively exploring new concepts and tools.
The code, workflows, and ideas are subject to breaking changes at any time in this early stage of development.

### Primary Focus

To get off the ground the focus is strictly on the peer-to-peer distribution of Docker images backed by a blockchain of identifiers.

## Contributing

Before getting started, take a moment to review our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/pyrsia/.github/blob/main/contributing.md).

## Node and CLI

There are two components of this project

- **[CLI](cli/)**: A basic interface which communicates with a node.
- **[Node](node/)**: An instance of the Pyrsia daemon which can participate in the network with other nodes.

### Getting Started

1. Setup rust on your local machine as described in [Rust's getting started guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
2. `cd pyrsia_node`
3. `cargo run`
