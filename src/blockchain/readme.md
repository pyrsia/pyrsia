# Pyrsia Blockchain Network Crate

This crate provides the "input" and "output" trait for interacting with the network consensus.

This will encompass:

- recording new "transaction" accepting generic payload
- returning finalized blocks

## Getting started

This can be built from the project root since it's apart of the workspace.

### Running the example Node

```
cargo build --examples
```
