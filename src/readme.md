# Pyrsia Library

Principal set of modules which make up the [Node](../pyrsia_node) and [CLI](../pyrsia_cli) components.

## Terminology

- **Metadata**: The information surrounding and describing the "data"
- **Network**: Refers to the distributed topology of Nodes connected over the internet
- **Node API**: Contains all the RESTful endpoints which allow integration with Pyrsia, primarily for the CLI

## Sub-Crates
