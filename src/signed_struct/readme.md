# Signed Struct

:warning: This nested crate depends on the [signed](../signed/) crate accompanying it which defines the underlying types that **can not** be exposed due to rust's handling of procedural macro crates. See https://github.com/pyrsia/pyrsia/issues/110 for history.
Please see the conversation in https://github.com/pyrsia/pyrsia/issues/110 for more details.
