//!
//! The signed JSON associated with a struct can be stored or sent in a message as a representation
//! of the contents of the struct. The signatures can be validated to verify that the contents of
//! the JSON have not been modified since the JSON was signed. Multiple signatures can be applied to
//! a signed struct.
//!
//! The first thing that you will do with this module is to use its `create_key_pair` function to
//! create a key pair. You will use the private key in the key pair to sign structs. The public key
//! is used to identify the signer.
//! ```
//! // Use adjecent crate (as dictated by Rust)
//! use signed::signed::{SignatureKeyPair, create_key_pair, JwsSignatureAlgorithms};
//! let key_pair: SignatureKeyPair = create_key_pair(JwsSignatureAlgorithms::RS512).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! The next thing to do is define some signed structs. Signed structs implement the `Signed` trait.
//! However, it is not recommended that you implement the `Signed` trait directly. Instead, you
//! should annotate the struct like this <br>
//! `   #[signed_struct]` <br>
//! `   struct Foo<'a> {` <br>
//! `       foo: String,` <br>
//! `       bar: u32,` <br>
//! `       zot: &'a str,` <br>
//! `   }` <br>
//!
//! This annotation runs a macro that add some fields to support the Signed trait, implements the
//! signed trait, and generates getters and setters for the struct. There is not a full example of
//! its use here to avoid Cargo complaining about a circular dependency. You can see a detailed
//! example in the source for `signed_struct/tests/lib.rs'. This is the best example of how to use
//! signed struct. You should read it.
//!
//! Getters are generated with the signature `fn field(&self) -> &type`.
//!
//! Setters are generated as `fn field(&mut self, val: type)`. In addition to setting their field,
//! the setters also call the `clear_json()` method provided by the `Signed` trait. This removes
//! any JSON currently associated with the struct because it is no longer valid after the struct's
//! field has been modified.
//!
//! You should not create instances of the struct directly. Instead, you should use the generated
//! `new` method. To create an instance of the `Foo` struct shown above, you could write something
//! like this: <br>
//! `let foo = Foo::new(foo_value, bar_value, zot_value);`
//!
//! It is recommended that signed structs be defined in a separate module that contains just the
//! signed struct. This is so that nothing but the generated getters and setters can access the
//! struct's fields.  Note that signed structs are not allowed to have public fields.
